# Cheap Coke

Helping you pick which major (Australian) supermarket chain to shop at, based purely on the price of a coke.

## How Can I help out?

Buy me a coke?

## How it Works

Dig into the scripts in the /data folder. Basically we need all the supermarket locations and then we scrape the prices from a third party service. From there when the user loads up the page we need to find their closest coles and woolies, and then see which has the cheaper price for cans and bottles.

These prices need to be pulled automatically on a daily basis (thanks github actions!) to ensure they remain fresh as supermarket specials change weekly.
